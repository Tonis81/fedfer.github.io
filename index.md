## About
I'm a first year PhD student in Statistics at [Duke University](http://stat.duke.edu), North Carolina. Previously, I obtained a Bachelor degree in ["Economics and Finance"](http://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/EconomicsFinance/Pages/default.aspx) at Universit√† degli studi di Bologna (the oldest in the world!). I continued my studies in Turin where I collected a master degree in ["Stochastics and Data Science"](http://www.master-sds.unito.it/do/home.pl) at the University of Turin and in parallel a master in "Statistics and Applied Mathematics" at [Collegio Carlo Alberto](http://carloalberto.org). In the meanwhile, I did an exchange period at the University of Lund, Sweden. That was definitely fun.


## Interests and Research  
My research interests are wide and not well-defined yet. They include Bayesian Nonparametric, Network modelling and Basketball analytics. For my master thesis I worked on a Bayesian nonparametric approach to Species Discovery with my supervisor [Stefano Favaro](http://www.carloalberto.org/people/faculty/fellows/favaro/) and [Federico Camerlenghi](http://www-dimat.unipv.it/~camerlenghi/). We are now trying to apply Multi-armed bandits to US political polls.


## TA and Tutoring (add reference and check esithate)
I will work as a TA in the 2018 Spring semester and I cannot wait to do it. In the meanwhile, I am avaliable as tutor for every statistical course under 400 (except 340). If you need any information, don't esithate to contact me!
