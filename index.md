## About
I'm a third year PhD candidate in Statistics at [Duke University](http://stat.duke.edu), North Carolina. Previously, I obtained a Bachelor degree in ["Economics and Finance"](http://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/EconomicsFinance/Pages/default.aspx) at Universit√† degli studi di Bologna (the oldest in the world!). I continued my studies in Turin where I received a master's degree in ["Stochastics and Data Science"](http://www.master-sds.unito.it/do/home.pl) at the University of Turin and in parallel a master in "Statistics and Applied Mathematics" at [Collegio Carlo Alberto](http://carloalberto.org). In the meanwhile, I did an exchange period at the University of Lund, Sweden. 

In my free time, I really enjoy climbing. This is a map [map](https://github.com/fedfer/climbing/blob/master/climbing.html) created with the R package leaflet of the places and routes that I climbed! The code can be found in this [Github repo](https://github.com/fedfer/climbing/).


## Interests and Research  

My research interests include Bayesian Modeling, Bayesian Nonparametric, Bayesian Factor regression, Hierarchical Models, Scalable Algorithms for Bayesian Models, Spatial models.

I am currently working on building models for environmental epidemiology with my PhD supervisor [David B. Dunson](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~dunson/). In particular, we are interested in modelling complex-dose response curves for chemical exposures. This application presents several statistical challenges such as highly correlated covariates and often the number of covariates exceeds the number of observations.

For my master thesis I worked on a nonparametric Multi-Armed Bandits for Species Discovery with my Master supervisor [Stefano Favaro](http://www.carloalberto.org/people/faculty/fellows/favaro/) and [Federico Camerlenghi](http://www-dimat.unipv.it/~camerlenghi/). We are currently trying to apply Multi-armed bandits to iterative experimental design in multi-tissue single-cell RNA-seq data together with [Bianca Dumitrascu](https://b2du.github.io/).
